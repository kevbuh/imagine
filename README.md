#  imagine

Replace anything you can see with anything you imagine, enabled by the power AR/VR video prompting via "Segment Anything" and "ControlNet". 

ControlNet:
- Neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions.

Segment Anything:
- The Segment Anything model produces high quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image.
